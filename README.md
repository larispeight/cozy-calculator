# â˜• Cozy Calculator  
A simple, warm calculator project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” made as part of my JavaScript learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
I wanted to make something that feels soft, rounded, and inviting. Nobody wants a boring calculator.

## ðŸŒ¼ Why I Made This

Iâ€™m currently *trying to* deep-diving into JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation, focusing on understanding how things work instead of rushing through. 
This calculator helped me connect logic with layout, and gave me a fun space to practice code structure and event listeners.

Iâ€™m also exploring how to bring my personality into technical projects.

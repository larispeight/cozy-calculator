# Cozy & Floral Calculator üå∏

## üåº Why I Made This

I‚Äôm currently *trying to* deep-diving into JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation, focusing on understanding how things work instead of rushing through. 
Building this calculator made me connect logic with layout, refine my code structure, and gain more confidence working with Javascript. For the first time I also looked into user experience by adding accessibility features, sound feedback, display limits, night mode, and zoom functionality.

Beyond the HTML/CSS/JS, I'm also exploring how to bring my personality into technical projects.
